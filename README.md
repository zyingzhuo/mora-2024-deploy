## Code Highlights / Challenges

When a user types in the search bar up above we make a POST request based on the information typed and append below. Uses regex to correctly find the question the user is looking for.

```
const searchBar = document.getElementById("searchBar");
  searchBar.addEventListener("keyup", async (e) => {
    const res = await fetch("/search-question", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({
        title: e.target.value,
      }),
      headers: {
        "Content-type": "application/json",
      },
    });
    const questions = await res.json();
    const ul = document.getElementById("suggestions");
    ul.innerHTML = "";

    if (e.target.value) {
      for (let question of questions) {
        const newli = document.createElement("li");
        const newa = document.createElement("a");
        const newaText = document.createTextNode(question.title);
        newa.appendChild(newaText);
        newa.setAttribute("href", `/questions/${question.id}`);
        newli.appendChild(newa);
        ul.appendChild(newli);
      }
    }
  });
```

## Challenges

The biggest challenge was understanding the concepts of votes in general. We initially added it as a data type in our questions and answers table- but it was much more complex and realized we needed separate tables for each question_votes and answer_votes. These tables needed to hold information on who made the upvote/like and what question it was in relation to. More on what question the upvote was related to challenged us to look at the hidden elements in our .pug file and we realized that hidden information about the question and user stored in each file was essential to tackling this problem.
